This is just a test to see how images would appear if 'dropped' into an issue & then the file name referred to in a file for producing the site.

This .md file was created & updated very easily:  

1.  I clicked on the `+` sign after the folder name, and gave the file a name  
2.  I started typing onscreen  
3.  I navigated (in another tab) to the issue created by pierzen, clicked on the pencil, and then copied the url for the image  
4.  I pasted the url into this file &   
5,  I kept typing then saved this.
